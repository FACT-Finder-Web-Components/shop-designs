Below is a list of example shops build with FACT-Finder Web Components.

Be sure to have the same version than the one used in the example shop you are watching. 
We suggest to always integrate the latest version, but if you insist on digging in old versions,
feel free to use the git history of this project.

 > Note that *Demo 2* was originated in [this repo](https://github.com/FACT-Finder-Web-Components/example-shop-impl)
 and hence its older history can be found there.
